I used ChatGPT to help create a base to build on. I used several statements. They are as follows:

Write me an A* Pathfinding algorithm in C#
Write me an A* Pathfinding algorithm in C# that loads cities with coordinates from a csv
Can you change the AStar class above to use breadth-first search
Can you change the AStar class above to use depth first search?
can you change the AStar class above to use ID-DFS search?
I got an error. startNode in the RetracePath function call does not seem to be defined
You did pass startNode to DepthLimitedSearch, but it was passed into the currentNode variable. No startNode is defined in that method though when you then pass it to RetracePath
I'm sorry, this seems like it is having issues overall. Can we start over with a fresh implementation of a depth limited search?
Can you generate me a best-first search?
The previous example does find a path, but it does not seem to be showing the path. You only ever add the start node to the path before returning
you only assign the end node to path, but I need all the nodes in the path from start to finish
